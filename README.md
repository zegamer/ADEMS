# ADEMS
ADEMS is a Absolute Distributed Environment Monitoring System. This Project describes a real-time distributed network that monitors air quality on a street-by-street level by placing our very small and cheap modules on an existing network of Cabs (Ola, Uber etc.). The major advantage is we are not required to setup static monitoring stations.
